# Description: 

Geox-Tweak-Xfce is a tool for customize Xfce appearance. It is an alternative to the configuration tools for 'appearance of xfce desktops, which are scattered, and require several manipulations to obtain a consistent theme.
Geox-Tweak is easy to use, and allows to change the gtk themes, the window decoration and the icons theme (including libreoffice buttons color) in a coherent way and in one click. No more dark icons on a dark theme, which make them invisible. 

Several themes are included, among which: Arc, Mint-Y, Adapta, Qogir, Matcha, McOS-MJV, Pro-dark-xfce ...

It also makes it easy to change the organization of xfce panels, making it possible to make your desktop look like Windows 10, 95, or gnome2, xubuntu, unity, mxlinux...

It also makes it possible and easy to change the color of the folder icons, thanks to the use of the "papirus-folder" script.

GeoX-TweaK installs with a set of software to improve the appearance of Xfce:
  - Plank is an application launch bar similar to that of MacOS
- Dockbarx is another launch bar, which integrates with the Xfce panel, and which works a bit like that of Windows
- Xfdashboard offers Xfce the possibility of operating as Gnome, by displaying an overview of all the windows open when you go to the top left corner of the screen. It also allows you to search for applications.
- Synapse is a software that allows you to quickly launch software or documents using the keyboard.

It is by installing and configuring these tools that GeoX-TweaK-Xfce allows you to transform your xfce desktop to make it look like what you want.
